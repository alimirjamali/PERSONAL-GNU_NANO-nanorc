# About this repository
## Basic Introduction
This repository contains my personal [GNU nano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_nano)'s nanorc file.
I barely use nano these days, yet I still love it so much. I created this repository to honor my good old memories of using nano.

## Background
[GNU nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/) was my go-to text editor once I started using GNU/Linux.
It was the easiest terminal based text editor and was supplied with most Distros I used at the beginning.
I did not want to invest enough time to learn Vim/Emacs at that point.
A simple, basic, easy to use editor was needed to create/modify configuration files and/or Bash scripts.
Nano was the most obvious editor once I started using it.
